n today’s Practical Session, you should continue work (or start work, if you haven’t already started!)
on Assignment 2, to create a program that manages a game of Othello for two players.
I suggest that there are three things that you should work on in today’s Practical and get help
from the Demonstrators, if required.
1. As a starting-point, you should give some thought to the overall structure of your program.
The following is the pseudocode I suggested in the lecture last Tuesday:
Main program
Initialise the board
Initialise the players
Print out the board
Play the game
Determine the winner
Print out the result
Print the result to the file
Of course, you are free to modify this or to take a completely different approach. It may also
be the case that your initial structure will be modified as you develop your solution.
2. Secondly, you should consider the data that you need and the data structures that you will
require to store these data. I would strongly recommend the use of C structs and enums to
help you organise the data.
You should ensure that you know how to create structures in C and how to use structs.
3. Thirdly, as I suggested, you should try to get some simpler aspects of your solution imple-
mented. I suggest that you start with taking user input from the keyboard and taking the
board and printing it out on the screen.
Recall that it is not necessary to develop a graphical interface: all that is required is to take
as input a player’s move from the keyboard and to print the board out on the screen using
characters and strings. An example of the output to the screen is presented overleaf.
$ othello
*** Welcome to Othello! ***
Enter name of Player 1 (Black): John
Enter name of Player 2 (White): Tigger
Score: John (Black) 2:2 Tigger (White)
