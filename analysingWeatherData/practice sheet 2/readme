1. Watch and listen to the presentation on libraries and their creation and use in CLion.
If you have any questions, make sure that you ask one of the Demonstrators after the presentation.
2. Follow the instructions to create an application p2q2 to calculate and print out the average
of ten numbers. As part of this, create a file p2q2.c containing your main program.
Ensure that you know how this code works. Experiment with changing various constants and
other pieces of code.
3. Follow the instructions to create an application p2q3 to read weather data from a file
weather.txt. Your main program should be in a file p2q3.c.
Ensure that you know how this code works. Experiment with changing various constants and
other pieces of code.
What happens if you move the declarations from outside the main function to inside it?
Experiment with this.
What happens if the file weather.txt does not contain any data? What happens if you do
not have access to it, it does not exist or it is not readable? What happens if it contains more
that five lines? Experiment with these aspects.
